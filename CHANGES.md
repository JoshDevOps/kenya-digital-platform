# Changes Made to Fix Compilation Errors

## 1. Created Missing SessionRoom Component

Created a new file at `/src/pages/SessionRoom.js` with the following features:
- Functional component that handles the sessionId parameter from the route
- Loading, error, and content states
- UI elements for displaying session details
- Join session button that links to the meeting URL

## 2. Addressed Dependency Issues

The following dependencies were identified as missing or not properly installed:
- aws-amplify (used in AuthContext.js, index.js, and api.js)
- react-player (used in VideoPlayer.js)

Created test files to verify if the modules are accessible:
- `/src/tests/aws-amplify-test.js`
- `/src/tests/react-player-test.js`

Created a script to reinstall dependencies:
- `/reinstall-dependencies.sh`

## 3. Added Unit Test for SessionRoom Component

Created a test file at `/src/tests/SessionRoom.test.js` with the following test cases:
- Verifies that the component renders loading state initially
- Verifies that the component renders session details after loading

## 4. Added Documentation

Created a README.md file with:
- Description of the compilation errors and how they were fixed
- Instructions on how to fix dependency issues
- Overview of the project structure
- List of dependencies
